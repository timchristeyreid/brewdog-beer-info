# brewdog-beer-info

Creating an SQL App using FastAPI with SQLite to implement a database of beers. 

The Punk IPA API (https://punkapi.com/) has been used to retrieve data and store it within a SQLite DB, which is then integrated into FastAPI to allow users to query available beers. 

The purpose of the app is to showcase understanding of both retrieving infromation form a publically available API and to showcase the use of FastAPI and its capabilities.
