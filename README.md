# brewdog-beer-info

This project uses the Brewdog Punk IPA API (https://punkapi.com/) to create a SQLite DB, which is then integrated into FastAPI to allow users to query available beers. 

The purpose of the app is to allow for showcasing understanding of both retrieving infromation form a publically available API and to showcase the use of FastAPI and its capabilities.
